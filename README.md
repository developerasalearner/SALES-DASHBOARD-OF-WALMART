# SALES-DASHBOARD-OF-WALMART
Introduction: -
I design a sales report on the sales of Walmart USA by using of Microsoft Power BI.
In this report I just analyse the following things to get the useful insights
	Profit with respect to state 
	Profit with respect to Product Category
	Sales with respect to Product Category
	Sales with respect to Individual Products

Insights we can extract: -
	Behalf of Profit v/s State
•	The company get its highest profit from the sates of California
•	The second highest is in Washington
•	And the company face losses in two states like Arizona and Colorado
•	The sales in the states like New Mexico, Idaho, Wyoming and Oregon is not that much satisfactory but there are no losses 
•	So, the company have to work on the above states to boost their business as well as in another two states where the company was facing the losses to minimize it….

	Behalf of Profit v/s Category
•	According to the tree map between Profit and Category there are 3 to 6 products are getting the majority sales among other products.
•	There are 3 hero products from the company which have the hights profit among other products (highest is the Copiers, then Accessories, then Binders...)
•	There are also some least profitable products like Fasteners, supplies, tables etc on which the company have to work on the sales or supply.
	Behalf of Sales v/s Category
•	According to the pie chart between the sales and the category there are three types of structures we can derive like Chairs, Phone, Tables are the most sold products…
•	Then storage, accessories, and Binders are the products which comes at the second most sold items….
•	Then the other items come which have the least sold margin…...
	Behalf of Sales v/s Individual product
•	From the table of sales and individual products we can observe the individual sales of a particular product as well as we can arrange them in increasing order also….

Overall output: -
	We can derive that the Copier have the most profitable margin but it is not the product which have the maximum sales.
	The most sold product is Chairs, but the profit margin of chairs has the less contribute towards the whole profit of the company.
	The profit as well as the sales of Phones have almost same contribution towards profit and sales.
	Papers are also be a hero product because it has a broad contribution in profit but the sales are not satisfactory, so if the company focus on the sales of this product, then it may be more profitable for the company. 
	And as shown in the bar graph the two states have the most contribution in the sales as well as in the profit, they are California, and Washington.
